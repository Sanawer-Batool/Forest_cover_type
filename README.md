Project Description: Forest Cover Type Classification using Random Forest

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to classify forest cover types based on cartographic and environmental variables. The task involved multiple stages, starting from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

1. Data Preprocessing

The dataset contained various numerical and categorical features describing forest conditions.

Initial preprocessing included handling missing values (if any), standardizing feature scales, and encoding categorical variables where necessary.

Since the dataset was imbalanced across different cover types, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was considered to balance minority classes. This ensured that the model learned effectively from all classes instead of being biased towards majority classes.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We used visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand feature distributions and correlations.

Feature importance analysis highlighted which environmental factors had the strongest impact on cover type classification.

3. Model Selection and Training

After experimenting with multiple algorithms, we trained a Random Forest Classifier, which is well-suited for handling large datasets with mixed data types.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the number of trees and depth of the forest for the best performance.

4. Model Evaluation

The model achieved an overall accuracy of 94%, indicating strong predictive performance.

The classification report showed high precision, recall, and F1-scores across most classes, with particularly strong results for majority cover types (Classes 1, 2, and 7).

While minority classes (such as Class 4 and 5) had slightly lower recall, the model still captured their patterns reasonably well.

5. Conclusion
This Random Forest model proved effective for forest cover type classification, delivering reliable predictions across diverse categories. With further improvements such as advanced feature engineering or ensemble methods, the modelâ€™s performance could be enhanced for minority classes.
